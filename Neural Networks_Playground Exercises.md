A First Neural Network

Task 1: A single neuron with a linear activation function (or no activation function, which is equivalent to a linear activation) cannot learn nonlinearities. This is because a single neuron with linear activation performs a linear transformation of the input features. The accuracy would likely be low, reflecting the model's inability to separate the moon-shaped clusters effectively.
We'll start by setting up a neural network with a single neuron in the hidden layer and no activation function (or a linear activation function).

Task 2: Increasing the number of neurons in the hidden layer and introducing a nonlinear activation function like ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) should allow the model to learn nonlinear relationships.When you increase the number of neurons in the hidden layer to 2 and introduce a nonlinear activation function like ReLU, you should observe an improvement in the model's ability to capture nonlinear relationships. This is because multiple neurons can create more complex decision boundaries, and the nonlinearity introduced by ReLU allows for bending these boundaries in non-linear ways.
We modify the network to have 2 neurons in the hidden layer and use ReLU as the activation function for these neurons.

Task 3: Increasing the number of neurons further to 3 with a nonlinear activation function should enhance the model's capacity to capture more complex nonlinear relationships in the data. By increasing the number of neurons in the hidden layer to 3 with ReLU activation, the model's capacity to learn complex patterns increases further.
We configure the network with 3 neurons in the hidden layer, all using ReLU activation.

Task 4: The right combination of neurons, layers, and other hyperparameters can achieve a test loss of 0.177 or lower. Increasing model size can improve fit and convergence speed but might not always lead to consistent improvements due to overfitting or other issues. There's a balance to be struck between model complexity and generalization. A model that's too simple might not capture all the nuances in the data, while an overly complex model might overfit to the training data, performing poorly on unseen data. Finding the smallest model that achieves the desired test loss requires experimentation and may involve trying different numbers of neurons, layers, learning rates, and regularization techniques. The suggested architecture with 3 layers (3-3-2 neurons) is a good starting point, and you may find that it performs well if tuned correctly, but there's no one-size-fits-all solution.
We do experiment with various configurations, starting with the suggested architecture of 3 layers with 3, 3, and 2 neurons respectively, and adjust learning rates, regularization, etc., to find an optimal small model.

Neural Net Initialization

Task 1: 
Expected Outcome: Each time you run the model with a different random initialization, you might notice that the shape of the model output converges to different solutions. The XOR problem requires a nonlinear decision boundary, and depending on the initialization, the network might converge to different local minima that correctly or incorrectly classify the XOR data points.
Insights: This variability in outcomes highlights the role of initialization in non-convex optimization problems like training neural networks. Different initial weights can lead the optimization process (e.g., gradient descent) to different local minima or saddle points on the error surface. This underlines the importance of initialization strategies in neural network training, as they can significantly impact the model's ability to learn and generalize.

Task 2:
Expected Outcome: With a more complex model, you might find that the results become more stable across different initializations. The increased capacity provided by the extra layer and nodes could allow the network to explore a larger space of possible solutions, potentially leading to a more consistent convergence to good solutions that correctly solve the XOR problem.
Insights: Increasing model complexity can sometimes add stability to the training results, as the model has more parameters to work with, which can help in escaping poor local minima. However, this is not a guarantee, and there's also a risk of overfitting with more complex models, especially if the data is limited or the complexity is much higher than needed to solve the problem at hand.

Neural Net Spiral
```

Task 1:
To train the best model using only the features X1 and X2:

Model Architecture: Start with a simple model and gradually increase complexity by adding layers and neurons. For a spiral dataset, deep networks with multiple layers can capture the complex patterns more effectively than shallow ones.

Activation Functions: Use nonlinear activation functions like ReLU for intermediate layers to introduce nonlinearity, enabling the model to learn complex patterns.

Learning Rate: The learning rate controls how much the model's weights are adjusted during training. A smaller learning rate might lead to better convergence but slower training. Conversely, a higher learning rate might speed up training but could overshoot the minimum loss.

Regularization: Techniques like L1/L2 regularization or dropout can help prevent overfitting, especially as the model complexity increases.

Batch Size: The size of the training batches can affect the stability and speed of the convergence. Smaller batches can provide a regularizing effect and more up-to-date gradient estimates, but larger batches offer computational efficiency.

Iterations/Epochs: Ensure you train the model for a sufficient number of epochs to allow convergence, adjusting based on observations of the training and validation (test) loss.

Evaluation: The best test loss and the smoothness of the model output surface will indicate the model's performance. A lower test loss and a smoother output surface suggest a better model.

Task 2:
Adding transformed features like cross products or trigonometric functions of the existing features can sometimes help the model learn complex patterns more easily.

Feature Transformation: Apply transformations like sine or cosine to X1 and X2, or create cross-product features. These transformations can help in capturing the cyclical nature of the spiral pattern.

Model Re-evaluation: After adding these new features, retrain your neural network. You might need to adjust the model architecture or learning settings to accommodate the increased dimensionality and complexity of the feature space.

Comparison: Compare the performance of the model with the additional features against the original model. A better model would not only have a lower test loss but might also have a smoother output surface, indicating a better fit to the spiral pattern.

Insights: Adding transformed features can make the model more expressive, potentially leading to better performance. However, it's also essential to balance the complexity to avoid overfitting.
